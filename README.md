# SeniorResearch_AI-Chatbots-MoralDilemmas
 This GitHub repository is the home of my CSC 450 Senior Research Project
 ## Objective
 The objective of this research is to learn more about AI Chatbots and how they rationalize morality and if they can experience moral dilemmas at all. Additionally, this research will build on existing research by using actual AI Chatbots (ChatGPT and Claude) to compare human responses to moral dilemmas to that of the AIsâ€™.
